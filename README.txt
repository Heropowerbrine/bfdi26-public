so here's what you gotta do

1. swapping between bf/pico mixes for both oneshot and blue golfball
2. recode yoylefake (IN HSCRIPT)
3. recode the app resizing script (IN HSCRIPT)
4. recode the double note trail thing (IN HSCRIPT /vechett just port it from codename to psych)
4. general optimizations and fixes
5. add anything that's missing from v1 songs

do not worry about anything freeplay related. all will be handled by me
also, don't make the source code public, i dont want my half assed code to be public. and don't add me to the credits
